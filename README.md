In this project you will be first brought to a table of contents which contains 4 sections. 
In section CHILDHOOD, I wrote a paragraph about my childhood. In section TEENAGE YEARS, I wrote
a paragraph about my years being a teen. In section FUTURE DREAMS, I wrote a paragraph about what 
I want to do in the future. In section FACTS ABOUT ME, I made a list containing unique facts about me
