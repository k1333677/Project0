          <h2> TEENAGE YEARS </h2>
          <p> As of right now I am interested in drawing and I am currently focused
              on studying and playing tennis. I still love to eat a lot of food and travel
              around the world. My favorite color is yellow and my favorite movie
              is Narnia. I am in highschool right now, and I am about to be a 10th
              grader. I have 3 pet birds as well. I am very excited for what
              is to come. </p>
