                 <h2> CHILDHOOD </h2>
                 
                 <p>I was born in Pearland, Texas. My favorite thing to do as a child 
                 was to play in the park. I liked to eat a lot of chocalate and fruit.
                 I have 1 younger sister who i played with. We are only 1 year apart so 
                 it was a lot of fun. My favorite childhood trip was to Sea World 
                 becuase I love to see animals. My childhood was very fun and happy.</P>
